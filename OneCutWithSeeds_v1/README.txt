//  USAGE  INSTRUCTIONS
//
//	In the command line type:
//	
//	OneCut <imageFileName> [<numBinsPerChannel> <colorSep_slope>]
//
//	Default values: numBinsPerChannel=16 colorSep_slope= 0.5
//
//	Example: OneCut frida_small.jpg 64 0.1
//	or       OneCut frida_small.jpg 
//
//
//	Once the image is opened you can scribble with left and right
//	mouse buttons on the object and the background in the 
//	"Scribble Image" window. Once the scribbles are given you can 
//	segment the image.You can keep repeatedly adding scribbles and 
//	segmenting until the result is satisfactory.
//
// 	Use the following Short Keys:
//	 'q' - quit
//	 's' - segment
//	 'r' - reset (removes all strokes and clears all results)
//	 'k' - keep the scribbles and the segmentation
//	 'l' - load the scribbles
//	 '+' - increase brush stroke radius
//	 '-' - decrease brush stroke radius
//	 'right mouse button drag' - draw blue scribble
//	 'left mouse button drag' - draw red scribble
